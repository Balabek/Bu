                Russian air flights delivering military and humanitarian aid arrive daily.
                Moscow openly confirms it. It’s forthright about its relationship with Assad’s government – unlike
                Washington’s duplicitous agenda to topple it, no matter the cost in human life and misery.
                Sahakyan “confirm the presence of Russian combat forces fighting in Syrian” is propaganda
                rubbish, typical of what passes for journalism in America, substituting misinformation and bald
                faced lies for verifiable hard truths.
                Prior to the declaration of a military coup, the interim President Michel Kafando and
                Prime Minister Isaac Zida were placed under house arrest. The interim president was released
                after several days while protests erupted over the attempt to halt the upcoming poll.

                He clearly said earlier he’ll retain his leadership position only as long as Syrians want him.
                Otherwise, he’d step down. His daily burden is far more than ordinary people could handle. He
                continues going all out to defend Syria for Syrians. He deserve praise, not rebuke, for his efforts.
            </p>

            <p class="privacy_para">
                Disinformation repeated often enough getting most people to believe it is its greatest ally –
                the bigger the lie, the more likely. At the same time, if Damascus requests Russia’s military
                involvement, “it would be discussed and considered. So far it’s hard to hypothesize,” he explained.
                Most of all, Moallem and Assad welcome efforts made to resolve things diplomatically. Russia’s best
                previous attempts failed because Washington undermined them.
            </p>

            <p class="privacy_para">
                In late October 2014, hundreds of thousands of workers and youth stormed the parliament in the
                capital of Ouagadougou ousting former military dictator turned politician, Blaise Compaore,
                a staunch ally of France and the United States. Compaore fled to neighboring Ivory Coast while a
                compromised interim government was established to prepare for internationally-supervised elections
                in October 2015.
                Also the regiment was demanding a declaration of amnesty preventing any future attempts to prosecute
                them for crimes against the Burkinabe people. Over the course of the most recent coup, 10 people
                have been killed and over 100 injured.
            </p>

            <p class="privacy_para">
                The BBC World Service posted on its website that “The coup leader in Burkina Faso has said he is
                ready to hand over power to transitional civilian authorities, as the army is marching on the
                capital. Gen. Gilbert Diendere, who led last Thursday’s coup (September 17) by the presidential
                guard, also apologized to the nation. The military earlier said troops were moving on to Ouagadougou,
                adding that the plotters must disarm.” The conditions for the elections and the interim government
                would never have been implemented without the mass rebellion in October 2014 that toppled the
                former military regime in civilian clothes headed by Compaore. During the course of the unrest
                that created the conditions for the expulsion of Compaore, thousands of youth wore shirts and
                carried banners with the image of Sankara, evoking the revolutionary anti-imperialist period of
                the mid-1980s.
            </p>

            <p class="privacy_para">
                The African Union (AU) subsequently imposed sanctions on the coup leaders. In theory,
                the AU rejects all undemocratic seizures of power throughout the region and is mandated to
                work towards the restoration of civilian rule.
